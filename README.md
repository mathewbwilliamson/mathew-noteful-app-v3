# Note Storing App
============================

## Story
This web app was designed to store notes like Evernote. I built it in order to learn jQuery for the front end, and Node/Express for the backend. Once the user comes to the website, they will be able to add/edit/delete notes, folders, and tags. 

This app was completed in about two or three weeks.
